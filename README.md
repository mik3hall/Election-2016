_________________
County names have been made consistent across the elections. This includes Shannon County
in SD which is now Oglala Lakota County, to match prior I left it Shannon.

In some cases I couldn't find separate DC Ward numbers so spread the total evenly across
each Ward. 

I ignored split electoral votes.

In some cases 2012 and 2016 results were given by township, city. I got the county data
manually from interactive maps on NY Times election pages. Fortunately, these were states
without that many counties.

The data would be reusable if you would care to do so.
